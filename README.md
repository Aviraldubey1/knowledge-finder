# Marketing Knowledge Finder

**Theme:** Knowledge Discovery & Internal Search

## Problem

Marketing teams create a lot of briefs, reports, plans, and assets. These are scattered across folders and tools, so people waste time searching or rewrite content from scratch.

## Solution

Marketing Knowledge Finder is a simple internal search tool that:

- Indexes documents (mock data for this demo)
- Lets users search across title, content, topic, and tags
- Filters by team, project, and document type
- Shows a quick preview of the selected document
- Displays simple stats (total documents, number of teams)

## Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Hosted on Vercel
